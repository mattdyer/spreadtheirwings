				<h3>Jessica Dyer - Owner Teacher</h3>
                <p>
                	I would like to introduce myself for those that don’t know who I am! My name is
					Jessica Dyer. I was born and raised here in the Flathead Valley. After graduating
					from Flathead High, I went on to UM-Western in Dillon, MT and earned my
					Bachelor’s Degree in Elementary Education and obtained my MT State teaching
					license in 2005. I worked my first year of teaching in a multi-grade classroom on a
					Hutterite Colony near Cut Bank, MT before returning to the valley. I worked for
					several years in paraprofessional positions before starting full time as a preschool
					teacher in October 2013. I instantly fell in love with preschoolers and their
					wonderful ways and quickly decided to go back to school. I completed an online
					program through Dawson Community College and earned an Associate’s Degree
					in Early Childhood Education. I now live here in the valley with my husband and 4
					kids on our little hobby farm! It is truly a dream come true for me to be teaching
					in my very own program!

		    <h3>School Features</h3>
			  <p>Unlike child day-care centers,  this is a teaching preschool.  Lessons  include introductions to Math, Science Exploration, Beginning Sign Language,  Pre-reading Skills, and, of course, Daily Story Time.  Children practice Calendar Skills, Rhyming  Words, Letter Sounds, and much more.   Your child will also be exposed to many creative activities specifically  designed to develop their fine motor skills such as cutting, coloring, gluing,  stencils, painting, puzzles, and more.   Large motor skills are practiced though various games and music  activities.  Weekly Show-and Tell  encourages building self-esteem and speaking in front of others while sharing  their own personal interests.  During all  of this, proper social interaction is encouraged in a Christian  atmosphere.  </p>
<h3>Field Trips</h3>
<p>In the 4 to 5 year old classes,  there will be field trips scheduled occasionally to various local venues.  Some past field trips have included;  apple cider pressing, art lessons, library,  farms, fire station, and more. Parents will be notified of any pre-arranged  field trips and will be needed on occasion to drive.  </p>
<h3>Christian Lessons</h3>
<p>We are a Christian based  preschool located in Calvary   Lutheran Church.  Pastor Craig Nissen graciously volunteers his  time to introduce children to basic Biblical principles.  We visit every few weeks for a lesson based  on the letter of the week that we are studying.</p>
